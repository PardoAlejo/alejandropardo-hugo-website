I'm a Ph.D. Student at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en) in Saudi Arabia. I'm part of the Image and Video Understanding Lab [IVUL](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/ivul) under the supervision of Professor [Bernard Ghanem](http://www.bernardghanem.com/). I'm a former member of the Biomedical Computer Vision Lab [BCV](https://biomedicalcomputervision.uniandes.edu.co) at [Uniandes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) where I completed my M.Sc​. degree advised by [Pablo Arbelaez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k0nZO90AAAAJ&hl=en). I completed my undergrad studies in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at the same university. I've worked on Temporal Action Localization and Object Detection in the past. My current research interest is AI for Creative Video Editing and Understanding.
